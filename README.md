## Technologies Used

In building this backend application, we have carefully selected and integrated a variety of advanced technologies to ensure robustness, scalability, and security.

**Node.js**: At the heart of our application lies Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js enables us to execute JavaScript code server-side, providing a lightweight and efficient platform for building scalable network applications.

**Express.js**: Leveraging the capabilities of Node.js, we utilize Express.js, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework designed for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs by providing a robust set of features for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities.

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: To ensure secure authentication and authorization, we employ JSON Web Tokens (JWT). JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. By using JWT, we can securely transmit user information between the client and the server, enhancing the security of our application.

**dotenv**: To enhance configurability and portability, we make use of dotenv, a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. This allows us to manage configuration settings such as database connection strings, API keys, and environment-specific variables easily.

By integrating these cutting-edge technologies, we have created a backend application that is not only powerful and scalable but also secure and highly adaptable to evolving business needs.
